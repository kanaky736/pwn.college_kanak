Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /tmp directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{809tQIEyPWf_lTtNNX5v2HvQ9ZQ.QX2QTN0wSOyEzNzEzW}
```
